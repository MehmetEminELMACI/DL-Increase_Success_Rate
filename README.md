## CONTENTS :

1- Add layers and Increasing the number of neurons

2- Add Conv2D , MaxPooling and Falatten Layers
  - CNN (Convoloutional Neural Networks) deep learning network used to recognize pictures.
  - Conc2D --> The layer that allows us to read pictures with CNN
  - MaxPooling --> is a pooling operation that calculates the maximum, or largest, value in each patch of each feature map.
  - Flatten --> Combines layers (such as reducing 2 dimensions to 1 dimension) 
  
3- Add Conv2D layers and Reduce epochs  

4- Add Dropout layer
  - Dropout --> It randomly deletes some columns. It prevents us from loving one column more and not loving another.
  
5- Add BatchNormalization layer
  - BatchNormalization --> It normalizes after each data. (Normally data is scattered)
